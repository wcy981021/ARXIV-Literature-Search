# ARXIV-Literature-Search

This project is a Python + PyQt5 application for searching and downloading research papers from the arXiv platform. It offers two operational modes: connecting to a local or remote server hosting the search API, or directly querying the official arXiv API. Users can input keywords, specify search modes (precise or fuzzy), limit publication years, and set a maximum number of results. The tool retrieves entries from arXiv, displays them in a table, and provides an option to sort by title or publication date. Summaries and metadata are presented clearly, facilitating quick filtering. By selecting multiple papers, users can download their PDFs either directly from arXiv or via a configured server endpoint. Additionally, it offers exporting search results to CSV or text for record-keeping. For users running their own servers, the integrated network test dialog helps diagnose connectivity issues through ping or API checks. Configuration dialogs simplify switching between local and external networks, storing server credentials, and adjusting timeouts. This project aims to provide a convenient, customizable interface for researchers seeking to manage and download relevant preprints. All code is fully open source, encouraging modification and integration in personal workflows.
